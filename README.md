Observation 1:
  Capomulin and Ramicane have the most timepoints within the drug regiment and Propiva the fewest, the rest of the drug regimens are     hovering around the 170-180 mark.
  
 Observation 2:
  Mouse b128 seems to have reacted positively to its capomulin regimen, it tumor volume decreased significantly between its first and     last timepoint.
  
 Observation 3:
  The tumor volume of each mouse seems to be linked the weight of the mouse. The bigger the mouse the bigger the tumor, and this seems   to be backed up by the correlation coefficient being 0.84.
